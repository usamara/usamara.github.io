## 1. EDA Analysis: IPL stands for Indian Premier League
IPL is a twenty-20 cricket tournament played by cricket players from all over the world. BCCI is responsible for arranging and managing the IPL.
IPL was introduced by BCCI in the year 2008 and since then IPL has been played in India every year. There are players from different countries made to play for       one team, depending on the performance the teams will qualify for the semi-finals and then the Final tournament.
We will do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL), one of the most popular cricket leagues globally. We will analyze the IPL           dataset, which includes various statistics related to matches, players, teams, and performances over the years.
## 2. Data Exploration on Marijuana Arrests(D.C) & NYPD 
According to the ACLUâ€™s original analysis, marijuana arrests now account for over half of all drug arrests in the United States. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010.
The primary goal is to analyze trends, patterns, and disparities in marijuana-related arrests, considering various demographic factors and changes in legislation over time.

## 3. EDA Analysis: Personality Prediction 
The organization needs to classify the individuals based on their personality traits. The availability of high dimensional and large amounts of date has paved the way for increasing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by targeting specific people. This will increase the popularity and attractiveness of products and services. Some common examples: 
1. Personalizing the online advertisement campaigns. 
2. Incorporate a personality-based approach to increase the attractiveness of recommended products. 
3. Personality-based adaptations can also provide personalized visualization and better music recommendations. 

## 4. Data Exploration & Clustering on ALS patient data
The analysis aimed to uncover patterns and relationships within ALS patient data by combining K-means clustering and PCA. The silhouette score plot was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and a K-means model was applied to assign cluster labels to the data. PCA was then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data for visualization. The scatterplot of the PCA-transformed data with cluster colors provides insights into the grouping of ALS patients based on the identified features. 
The visual representation aids in understanding potential clusters or patterns that may exist in the data. 

## 5.Predictive Analytics: U.S. retail sales
We will use a Kaggle data set that will give the total monthly retail sales in the US from January 1992 until June 2021. 
This project aims to perform predictive analytics on U.S. retail sales data to identify trends, forecast future sales, and derive actionable insights for retailers and stakeholders. By leveraging historical sales data, the project will utilize machine learning techniques to build robust models that can predict future retail performance.
## 6. Predictive Analytics: Movie recommendation system using MovieLens data 
In this project using the MovieLens data set, create a recommender system that allows users to input a movie they like (in the data set) and recommends ten other movies for them to watch. This will provide personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience in selecting films.

## 7. Predicting Diabetes and Prediabetes Given Various Health and Lifestyle Factors
The project aims to address the challenge of predicting the risk of diabetes and prediabetes among individuals based on a range of health indicators and lifestyle factors. The primary question revolves around developing machine learning models capable of accurately identifying individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes or prediabetes based on their demographic information, health metrics, and lifestyle habits. And lastly, healthcare providers can implement targeted interventions and preventive measures to reduce the incidence of diabetes and its associated complications.
Our project aims to address a few key questions:
- Which behaviors are most closely linked with a diabetes or prediabetes diagnosis?
- Can we accurately predict diabetes within an individual, knowing certain characteristics?
- Is the BRFSS, as currently constructed, the best remote diagnosis tool at our disposal?
- Could we remove questions from the BRFSS or add entirely new ones to create an even better or just as good model for prediction?

## 8. EDA Analysis: Data Scientist Salary
With a focus on various aspects of employment, including work experience, job titles, and company locations, this dataset provides valuable insights into salary distributions within the industry. 

## 9. EDA Analysis: MLB league recommendation to management on how to improve attendance 
Using data on the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball (MLB) team, make a recommendation to management on how to improve attendance. Tell a story with EDA analysis and clearly explain the steps for management as an action point.

## 10. Data Presentation & Visualization: Crime Rate by State
The objective is to provide clear and insightful visual representations of crime data to facilitate understanding of trends, comparisons, and disparities in crime rates among states.
